# Picture in Picture JavaScript Project
The Picture in Picture JavaScript project is a web application that enables Picture in Picture (PiP) functionality for screen sharing. With this feature, users can select a media stream from their device, such as a screen or application window, and enjoy it in a floating video player while still being able to interact with other content or applications.

## Features

Users can select a media stream from their device, which may include screens, windows, or application views.

The application supports Picture in Picture mode, allowing users to watch the selected media stream in a floating window on top of other content.

### Responsive UI: 
The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across various devices and screen sizes.
